# capstoneproject
This capstone project is a “structured walkthrough” penetration test of a fictional company, Artemis, Incorporated (“Artemis”). A structured walkthrough is an organized procedure for a group of peers to review and discuss the technical aspects of various IT, IT Security, and IT Audit work products. The major objectives of a structured walkthrough are to find errors and to improve the quality of the product or service to be delivered.  Included are 5 parts - Perform Reconnaissance, Identify Targets and Run Scans, Identify Vulnerabilities, Threat Assessment, and Reporting. Each phase of this capstone highlights the steps that a penetration tester might take from beginning to end of a penetration test.
